# Flow Hub
Central repository of all study flow definitions.

All flow definitions must be matched with a published study. This allows any discussion about the accuracy of a flow definition to be tied with the original research. To reflect this the repository is organized by publication venue, such as journals conferences etc.

All of this is under exploratory development at the moment, so if you come across this page and want to learn more feel free to contact us.
